Genetic-Algorithms
==================

Java programs I created for my final year university project, entitled: "Genetic Algorithms in Path Finding &amp; Network Optimization Problems." All code presented here is my own work (Andy Ankrah, 3rd year mathematics student at Durham University).

Includes commented class files for the following programs:
Travelling Salesman Problem GA, 
Path finding around obstacles GA, 
Route rinding on maps GA.
